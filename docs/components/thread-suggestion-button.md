# AnswersThreadSuggestionButton

## Purpose

The `AnswersThreadSuggestionButton` is a specialized UI button component designed for displaying interactive thread suggestions within the answers feature. It provides a distinctive chat bubble-like appearance with pre-configured styling and icon integration, specifically used to suggest follow-up questions or related topics in conversation threads.

## Component Type

**Client Component** - While not explicitly marked with `'use client'`, this component is designed for interactive use with click handlers and should be treated as a client component when used with interactive functionality.

## Props Interface

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `variant` | `'question'` | No | `'question'` | Visual variant that determines styling and default icon |
| `leftIcon` | `ReactNode` | No | Auto-selected based on variant | Custom icon to display on the left side of the button |
| `className` | `string` | No | - | Additional CSS classes to apply to the button |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | No | - | Button content (typically text) |
| `...other` | `ComponentPropsWithRef<'button'>` | No | - | All standard HTML button props except `disabled` |
| `ref` | `Ref<HTMLButtonElement>` | No | - | Forward ref to the button element |

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { AnswersThreadSuggestionButton } from '@/components/answers/thread-suggestion-button';
import { CustomIcon } from '@/components/icons';

function ThreadSuggestions({ suggestions }: { suggestions: string[] }) {
  const handleSuggestionClick = (suggestion: string) => {
    // Handle suggestion selection
    console.log('Selected suggestion:', suggestion);
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
      {suggestions.map((suggestion, index) => (
        <AnswersThreadSuggestionButton
          key={index}
          variant="question"
          onClick={() => handleSuggestionClick(suggestion)}
        >
          {suggestion}
        </AnswersThreadSuggestionButton>
      ))}
      
      {/* Custom icon example */}
      <AnswersThreadSuggestionButton
        variant="question"
        leftIcon={<CustomIcon className="size-5" />}
        onClick={() => handleSuggestionClick('Custom suggestion')}
      >
        Ask something else
      </AnswersThreadSuggestionButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Functionality

- **Visual Variants**: Currently supports 'question' variant with distinctive chat bubble styling
- **Icon Integration**: Automatic icon selection based on variant or custom icon override
- **Interactive States**: Hover effects with color transitions
- **Accessibility**: Full button accessibility with proper forwarded refs
- **Flexible Content**: Accepts any ReactNode as children for flexible text/content display
- **Responsive Design**: Uses responsive typography and spacing classes

## State Management

This component is **stateless** and follows our architecture guidelines:
- No internal state management
- Relies on parent components for interaction handling
- Event handlers passed via standard button props
- No direct integration with TanStack Query or Zustand

## Side Effects

**No side effects** - This is a pure presentational component that:
- Does not make API calls
- Does not trigger external state changes
- Does not perform side effects beyond standard button interactions
- Relies entirely on parent components for business logic

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/components/icons` - ElbowLine icon component
- `@/lib/utils/cn` - Class name utility function

### External Dependencies  
- `class-variance-authority` - For variant-based styling
- `React` - Core React functionality and types

### Component Architecture
- Uses `cva` for consistent variant management
- Implements `forwardRef` for proper ref forwarding
- Follows our UI component patterns with proper TypeScript integration

## Integration

### Application Architecture
- **Domain**: Part of the answers feature domain (`/components/answers/`)
- **Usage Pattern**: UI component designed for chat/conversation interfaces
- **Composition**: Designed to be used in collections or suggestion lists
- **Parent Integration**: Typically used within answer threads, chat interfaces, or suggestion panels

### Data Flow
```
Parent Component → Props → AnswersThreadSuggestionButton → User Interaction → Event Handler (Parent)
```

## Best Practices

### Architectural Adherence
✅ **Component Decomposition**: Simple, focused component with single responsibility  
✅ **Reusability**: Domain-specific but reusable within answers feature  
✅ **TypeScript Integration**: Proper typing with variant props and ref forwarding  
✅ **Styling Consistency**: Uses CVA for maintainable variant system  

### Recommended Usage Patterns

1. **Batch Suggestions**: Use in arrays for multiple related suggestions
2. **Custom Icons**: Override default icons when context requires different visual cues  
3. **Event Handling**: Always provide meaningful onClick handlers in parent components
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper ARIA labels when button text isn't descriptive

### Performance Considerations
- Lightweight component with minimal re-render impact
- Icon components should be memoized if used in large lists
- Consider virtualization for very large suggestion sets

### Integration with State Management
```tsx
// Example with TanStack Query integration in parent
function SuggestedQuestions({ threadId }: { threadId: string }) {
  const { data: suggestions = [] } = useThreadSuggestions(threadId);
  const submitQuestion = useSubmitQuestion();
  
  return (
    <div className="suggestion-grid">
      {suggestions.map(suggestion => (
        <AnswersThreadSuggestionButton
          key={suggestion.id}
          onClick={() => submitQuestion.mutate(suggestion.text)}
        >
          {suggestion.text}
        </AnswersThreadSuggestionButton>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
