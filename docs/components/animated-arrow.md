# AnimatedArrow Component

## Purpose

The `AnimatedArrow` component provides a smooth, continuous animation of a downward-pointing arrow with visual effects including vertical movement, opacity changes, and a pulsing background. It's designed to serve as a visual indicator directing user attention downward, commonly used in hero sections or landing areas to encourage scrolling behavior.

## Component Type

**Client Component** - This component uses the `'use client'` directive (implicitly through framer-motion) because it relies on browser-specific animation APIs and client-side rendering for the continuous motion effects. The animations require access to the DOM and JavaScript execution context that's only available on the client side.

## Props Interface

| Prop Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | This component accepts no props and is fully self-contained |

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { AnimatedArrow } from '@/components/home/components/animated-arrow';

// Basic usage in a hero section
export const HeroSection = () => {
  return (
    <section className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Welcome to Our Site</h1>
      <p className="text-lg mb-12">Discover amazing content below</p>
      
      {/* Animated arrow to encourage scrolling */}
      <div className="absolute bottom-8">
        <AnimatedArrow />
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

// Usage in a call-to-action section
export const CTASection = () => {
  return (
    <div className="text-center py-16">
      <h2 className="text-2xl mb-4">Explore More</h2>
      <AnimatedArrow />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Functionality

### Core Features
- **Continuous Vertical Animation**: Smooth up-and-down movement with 4px total range (-2px to +2px)
- **Opacity Pulsing**: Synchronized opacity changes from 80% to 100% opacity
- **Background Effect**: Pulsing circular background with scale and opacity animations
- **Layered Animation**: Multiple animation layers with offset timing for visual depth
- **Infinite Loop**: Seamless, continuous animation cycle

### Animation Specifications
- **Duration**: 1.5 seconds per cycle
- **Easing**: `easeInOut` for smooth, natural motion
- **Background Delay**: 0.2 second offset for staggered effect
- **Scale Range**: Background scales from 80% to 110%

## State Management

**No State Management Required** - This component is purely presentational with no internal state, props, or external state dependencies. All behavior is handled through declarative framer-motion animations.

## Side Effects

**No Side Effects** - The component produces no side effects, API calls, or external interactions. It's a pure UI component focused solely on visual animation.

## Dependencies

### Direct Dependencies
- **framer-motion**: Animation library for motion effects
- **@/components/icons**: Icon system providing `PiArrowDownLine`

### Styling Dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes for layout and styling
- **Custom CSS Variables**: Uses `alphaNeutral` color token

## Integration

### Application Architecture Role
- **UI Layer Component**: Sits at the presentational layer of the component hierarchy
- **Home Page Feature**: Specifically designed for home page user experience
- **Reusable Animation**: Can be integrated into any section requiring scroll encouragement
- **Design System Element**: Follows established animation patterns and timing

### Typical Integration Points
```tsx
// Home page hero section
<HeroSection>
  <Content />
  <AnimatedArrow /> {/* Scroll indicator */}
</HeroSection>

// Section transitions
<SectionWrapper>
  <SectionContent />
  <AnimatedArrow /> {/* Transition guide */}
</SectionWrapper>
```

## Best Practices

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ **Component Decomposition**: Single-purpose, focused component
- ✅ **No Unnecessary Abstraction**: Simple, direct implementation without over-engineering
- ✅ **Domain Organization**: Properly placed in home feature directory
- ✅ **Client Component Usage**: Appropriate use of client-side rendering for animations

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimized Animations**: Uses CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
- **Efficient Re-renders**: No props or state changes prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle impact with focused functionality

### Usage Guidelines
- Use sparingly to maintain visual impact effectiveness
- Position with adequate spacing from other animated elements
- Consider accessibility implications for users with motion sensitivity preferences
- Pair with semantic HTML structure for screen reader compatibility

### Recommended Enhancements
```tsx
// Future enhancement for accessibility
<motion.div
  initial={{ y: 0 }}
  animate={!prefersReducedMotion ? animationProps : {}}
  // ... rest of props
>
