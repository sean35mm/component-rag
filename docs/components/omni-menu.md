# OmniMenu Component

## Purpose

The `OmniMenu` component serves as a contextual menu interface within the omnibar editor system. It provides users with a dropdown or overlay menu containing various options, commands, or actions that can be performed within the omni-editor context. This component is part of the omnibar's command palette functionality, offering quick access to features and navigation options.

## Component Type

**Server Component** - This component is implemented as a Server Component by default, following our architecture guidelines. It can be rendered on the server since it doesn't currently require client-side interactivity, event handlers, or browser APIs. If interactive features are added later, it may need to be converted to a Client Component with the `'use client'` directive.

## Props Interface

| Prop Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| *Currently no props* | - | - | - | This component doesn't accept any props in its current implementation |

*Note: The component interface may be extended with props as functionality is developed.*

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { OmniMenu } from '@/components/omnibar/omni-editor/omni-menu/omni-menu';

// Basic usage within omni-editor
export function OmniEditor() {
  return (
    <div className="omni-editor">
      <div className="editor-content">
        {/* Editor content */}
      </div>
      <OmniMenu />
    </div>
  );
}

// Integration with omnibar system
export function Omnibar() {
  return (
    <div className="omnibar">
      <OmniEditor>
        <OmniMenu />
      </OmniEditor>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Functionality

Currently, the component provides:

- **Basic Rendering**: Displays a placeholder menu structure
- **Foundation Structure**: Establishes the base for menu functionality

**Planned/Expected Functionality:**
- Command palette menu options
- Contextual actions and shortcuts
- Navigation menu items
- Search and filter capabilities
- Keyboard navigation support

## State Management

**Current Implementation**: No state management implemented

**Expected State Management Pattern**:
- **Zustand Store**: For menu visibility, selected items, and UI state
- **TanStack Query**: For dynamic menu items fetched from server
- **Local State**: For temporary UI states like hover and focus

```tsx
// Expected state management structure
interface OmniMenuState {
  isOpen: boolean;
  selectedIndex: number;
  searchQuery: string;
  menuItems: MenuItem[];
}
```

## Side Effects

**Current**: None

**Expected Side Effects**:
- Keyboard event listeners for navigation
- Click outside detection for menu dismissal
- Dynamic menu item loading
- Search query debouncing
- Focus management and accessibility

## Dependencies

**Current Dependencies**: None

**Expected Dependencies**:
- `@/hooks/use-keyboard-navigation` - For menu navigation
- `@/hooks/use-click-outside` - For menu dismissal
- `@/components/ui/dropdown-menu` - Base menu UI components
- `@/stores/omnibar-store` - Zustand store for omnibar state
- `@tanstack/react-query` - For dynamic menu data

## Integration

The `OmniMenu` component integrates into the larger application architecture as follows:

```
Omnibar (Root)
├── OmniEditor
│   ├── OmniMenu ← Current component
│   ├── Editor Content
│   └── Other Editor Components
└── Other Omnibar Components
```

**Integration Points**:
- **Parent**: `omni-editor` - Receives context and state from editor
- **Siblings**: Other omni-editor components for coordinated functionality
- **Data Flow**: Connects to omnibar state management system
- **Event System**: Participates in omnibar command execution

## Best Practices

This component follows our architectural guidelines:

✅ **Server Component Default**: Implemented as Server Component initially
✅ **Flat Component Structure**: Part of decomposed omnibar system
✅ **Domain Organization**: Located within omnibar feature domain
✅ **Lego Block Pattern**: Designed for composition with other omni components

**Recommended Development Patterns**:

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with server rendering, add client features as needed
2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Build menu functionality through smaller, reusable components
3. **State Co-location**: Keep menu-specific state close to the component
4. **Accessibility First**: Implement ARIA patterns for menu navigation
5. **Performance**: Use virtualization for large menu lists
6. **Testing**: Focus on keyboard navigation and accessibility testing

**Future Implementation Considerations**:
```tsx
// Expected evolved structure
'use client'; // When interactivity is added

export function OmniMenu({ 
  items,
  onSelect,
  isOpen,
  position 
}: OmniMenuProps) {
  // Implementation with full functionality
}
```

This component is currently in its foundational state and will evolve to become a key part of the omnibar's user interface system.
