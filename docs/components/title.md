# SubscribeDialogTitle Component

## Purpose

The `SubscribeDialogTitle` component provides a standardized title and description section for subscription dialog modals within the billing settings area. It renders accessible dialog title and description elements with consistent typography and layout, ensuring proper semantic structure for screen readers and maintaining visual consistency across subscription-related dialogs.

## Component Type

**Client Component** - While this component doesn't explicitly use the `'use client'` directive, it functions as a client component because it's designed to be used within dialog modals that require client-side interactivity. The component uses dialog primitives that need to be rendered on the client side for proper accessibility and modal functionality.

## Props Interface

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | `string` | Yes | The main title text displayed prominently at the top of the dialog |
| `description` | `string` | No | Optional descriptive text that provides additional context below the title |

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { SubscribeDialogTitle } from '@/components/settings/billing/subscribe-dialog/title';

// Basic usage with title only
<SubscribeDialogTitle 
  title="Upgrade to Pro Plan" 
/>

// Complete usage with title and description
<SubscribeDialogTitle 
  title="Choose Your Subscription Plan"
  description="Select the plan that best fits your needs. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time."
/>

// Within a complete dialog context
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from '@/components/ui/dialog';

<Dialog open={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>
  <DialogContent>
    <SubscribeDialogTitle 
      title="Upgrade Your Account"
      description="Unlock premium features and increase your usage limits with our subscription plans."
    />
    {/* Additional dialog content */}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

## Functionality

- **Semantic Dialog Structure**: Renders proper dialog title and description elements using `DialogTitlePrimitive` and `DialogDescriptionPrimitive` for accessibility compliance
- **Consistent Typography**: Applies standardized typography variants (`titleH4` for title, `paragraphMedium` for description) with consistent color scheme
- **Responsive Layout**: Uses flexbox layout with centered alignment and consistent spacing between elements
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only displays the description section when provided, maintaining clean layout for title-only scenarios
- **Accessibility**: Properly associates title and description with the dialog for screen reader compatibility

## State Management

This component is **stateless** and doesn't manage any internal state. It's a pure presentation component that receives data through props and renders static content. No TanStack Query or Zustand integration is required as it doesn't handle server state or complex client state management.

## Side Effects

**No side effects** - This is a pure presentation component that doesn't:
- Make API calls
- Trigger external state changes
- Perform any asynchronous operations
- Interact with browser APIs

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/components/ui/dialog` - Provides `DialogTitlePrimitive` and `DialogDescriptionPrimitive` for semantic dialog structure
- `@/components/ui/typography` - Provides the `Typography` component for consistent text rendering

### External Dependencies
- `React` - Core React library for component functionality
- `react` types - TypeScript definitions for React components

## Integration

The `SubscribeDialogTitle` component integrates into the larger application architecture as follows:

- **Domain-Specific Component**: Located within the billing settings domain (`src/components/settings/billing/`)
- **Dialog System Integration**: Works seamlessly with the application's dialog system, using proper primitives for accessibility
- **Design System Compliance**: Leverages the UI component library for consistent typography and styling
- **Subscription Flow**: Forms part of the subscription dialog workflow, providing the header section for various subscription-related modals

## Best Practices

This component adheres to our architectural guidelines:

✅ **Component Decomposition**: Follows the "Lego block" principle - small, focused component with single responsibility  
✅ **Reusability**: Domain-specific but reusable across different subscription dialogs within billing  
✅ **Accessibility**: Uses semantic dialog primitives for proper screen reader support  
✅ **Typography Consistency**: Leverages the design system's typography component for consistent styling  
✅ **Conditional Rendering**: Efficiently handles optional description prop without unnecessary DOM elements  
✅ **Props Interface**: Clear, well-typed interface with meaningful prop names  
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Pure presentation component without business logic or state management  
✅ **Integration Pattern**: Properly integrates with dialog system and broader billing feature architecture

The component exemplifies good practices for feature-specific UI components that maintain consistency while serving domain-specific needs.
