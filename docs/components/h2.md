# H2Mdx Component

## Purpose

The `H2Mdx` component is a specialized heading component designed for rendering H2 elements within MDX content, specifically for changelog items in the developers section. It provides consistent styling and typography for second-level headings in markdown-rendered documentation while maintaining design system standards.

## Component Type

**Server Component** - This component is a server component as it doesn't require client-side interactivity, state management, or browser APIs. It's a pure presentational component that renders static heading content, making it ideal for server-side rendering to improve performance and SEO.

## Props Interface

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `...props` | `Omit<HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>, 'color'>` | No | All standard HTML heading attributes except `color`, which is controlled by the Typography component's variant |

**Note**: The `color` prop is omitted to ensure consistent styling through the design system's typography variants.

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In MDX content for changelog items
import { H2Mdx } from '@/components/developers/changelog-item/customMdx/h2';

// Basic usage
<H2Mdx>API Version 2.1 Release</H2Mdx>

// With additional HTML attributes
<H2Mdx id="breaking-changes" className="scroll-target">
  Breaking Changes
</H2Mdx>

// In a changelog MDX file
# Changelog Entry

<H2Mdx>New Features</H2Mdx>
- Added new authentication endpoints
- Improved error handling

<H2Mdx>Bug Fixes</H2Mdx>
- Fixed rate limiting issues
- Resolved CORS configuration
```

## Functionality

- **Typography Integration**: Leverages the design system's Typography component with the `titleH2` variant
- **Semantic HTML**: Renders as a proper `h2` element for accessibility and SEO
- **Consistent Styling**: Ensures all H2 headings in MDX content follow the same visual hierarchy
- **Attribute Forwarding**: Accepts all standard HTML heading attributes while maintaining type safety
- **Design System Compliance**: Automatically applies consistent spacing, font weights, and color schemes

## State Management

**No State Management** - This is a stateless presentational component that doesn't require any state management. It simply renders content based on props without maintaining internal state or connecting to external state stores.

## Side Effects

**No Side Effects** - The component has no side effects, API calls, or external interactions. It's a pure component that renders based solely on its props.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/components/ui/typography` - Core Typography component for consistent text rendering

### External Dependencies
- `React` - For component definition and HTML attributes typing

### Type Dependencies
- `HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>` - Provides proper typing for heading element attributes

## Integration

The `H2Mdx` component integrates into the larger application architecture as part of the custom MDX component system:

```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ developers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ changelog-item/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ customMdx/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ h2.tsx          # This component
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ h1.tsx          # Other MDX heading components
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts        # MDX components export
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ChangelogItem.tsx   # Parent changelog component
â””â”€â”€ ui/
    â””â”€â”€ typography/             # Base typography system
```

**Integration Points**:
- **MDX Provider**: Used as a custom component mapping for `h2` elements in MDX content
- **Changelog System**: Specifically designed for developer documentation and changelog rendering
- **Design System**: Leverages the centralized Typography component for consistent styling
- **Content Management**: Enables rich markdown content with controlled styling

## Best Practices

### âœ… Follows Architecture Guidelines

1. **Server Component Usage**: Appropriately uses server component pattern for static content rendering
2. **Component Decomposition**: Simple, focused component that does one thing well
3. **Design System Integration**: Leverages centralized Typography component rather than custom styling
4. **Type Safety**: Uses proper TypeScript interfaces with strategic prop omission for design consistency
5. **Reusability**: Placed in domain-specific location (`developers/changelog-item`) while leveraging shared UI components

### âœ… Implementation Best Practices

- **Prop Forwarding**: Maintains flexibility while ensuring type safety
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper heading hierarchy for accessibility
- **Design System Compliance**: Delegates styling to the design system rather than implementing custom styles
- **Performance**: Lightweight component with no unnecessary overhead
- **Maintainability**: Simple implementation that's easy to understand and modify

### ðŸŽ¯ Usage Recommendations

- Use specifically for H2 headings in changelog MDX content
- Leverage HTML attributes for accessibility features like `id` for anchor links
- Maintain consistent heading hierarchy in MDX documents
- Consider using with table of contents generation for longer changelog entries
