# AnswersSharedThreadPage Component

## Purpose
The `AnswersSharedThreadPage` component provides a dedicated view for displaying shared answer threads to users. It renders a complete thread interface with chat functionality, filtering capabilities, and proper access control, specifically designed for shared thread scenarios where users can view and potentially interact with existing answer conversations.

## Component Type
**Client Component** - Uses the `'use client'` directive because it:
- Manages interactive chat functionality requiring client-side state
- Handles conditional rendering based on authentication state
- Integrates with multiple context providers that require client-side reactivity
- Provides real-time chat interactions and filtering capabilities

## Props Interface

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `thread` | `AnswersThreadWithMessages` | Yes | The complete thread object containing messages and metadata to be displayed in the shared view |

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { AnswersSharedThreadPage } from '@/components/answers/shared-thread-page';
import { AnswersThreadWithMessages } from '@/lib/types';

// In a page component or route handler
export default function SharedThreadRoute({ params }: { params: { threadId: string } }) {
  // Assume thread is fetched via server component or data fetching
  const thread: AnswersThreadWithMessages = await getSharedThread(params.threadId);

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">
      <AnswersSharedThreadPage thread={thread} />
    </div>
  );
}

// Example thread data structure
const exampleThread: AnswersThreadWithMessages = {
  id: 'thread-123',
  title: 'Product Integration Questions',
  messages: [
    {
      id: 'msg-1',
      content: 'How do I integrate the API?',
      timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:00:00Z',
      // ... other message properties
    }
  ],
  // ... other thread properties
};
```

## Functionality

### Core Features
- **Shared Thread Display**: Renders complete thread interface optimized for shared viewing
- **Access Control**: Implements authentication and authorization checks before displaying content
- **Responsive Layout**: Provides sticky header details on desktop with responsive behavior
- **Chat Interface**: Full-featured chat functionality with message display and interaction
- **Filtering System**: Integrated filtering capabilities for thread messages and content
- **Issue Reporting**: Built-in issue reporting functionality for user feedback

### Key Behaviors
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only displays chat interface when user has proper authentication
- **Shared Mode**: Operates in special shared mode with modified permissions and behaviors
- **Sticky Navigation**: Thread details remain visible during scrolling on larger screens
- **Zero Thread Creation**: Configured to prevent new thread creation in shared mode

## State Management

### Context Providers
- **AnswersThreadChatStoreProvider**: Manages chat state, messages, and thread interactions using Zustand
- **FiltersDrawerStoreProvider**: Handles filtering state and drawer visibility using Zustand

### Access Control State
- Utilizes `useAccessToken` hook to manage authentication state
- Tracks `isPublic`, `isAuthorizedAndVerified`, and `token` status
- Implements gate-keeping logic for content access

### State Flow
```tsx
// Authentication check → Context providers → Chat interface
token && (isAuthorizedAndVerified || isPublic) → Store providers → AnswersThreadChat
```

## Side Effects

### Authentication Effects
- Monitors access token changes and updates UI accordingly
- Handles public vs. authorized access scenarios
- Manages token-based API authentication for chat operations

### Chat Interactions
- Processes message sending and receiving through the chat store
- Handles real-time updates and message synchronization
- Manages scroll behavior and UI state updates

## Dependencies

### Internal Components
- `TabContainer`: Layout wrapper from main layout system
- `AnswersThreadChat`: Core chat interface component
- `SharedAnswersThreadChatTabDetails`: Thread metadata display component
- `ReportIssueDialog`: Issue reporting modal component

### Context and State
- `AnswersThreadChatStoreProvider`: Chat state management
- `FiltersDrawerStoreProvider`: Filtering functionality
- `useAccessToken`: Authentication state hook

### Types
- `AnswersThreadWithMessages`: Thread data structure
- `FC`: React functional component type

## Integration

### Application Architecture
```
Page Route → AnswersSharedThreadPage → TabContainer → Store Providers → Chat Interface
                    ↓
              Access Control Layer
                    ↓
           Authentication & Authorization
```

### Layout Integration
- Integrates with main tab-based layout system via `TabContainer`
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
- Sticky positioning for enhanced navigation experience

### Data Flow
1. **Thread Data**: Receives complete thread with messages from parent route/page
2. **Authentication**: Validates user access rights before rendering
3. **State Initialization**: Sets up store providers with thread data and token
4. **Chat Rendering**: Displays interactive chat interface with full functionality

## Best Practices

### Architecture Adherence
- ✅ **Client Component Usage**: Appropriate use of client component for interactive functionality
- ✅ **Component Decomposition**:decomposed into focused sub-components
- ✅ **State Management**: Proper use of Zustand stores through context providers
- ✅ **Reusability**: Leverages shared UI components and layout containers

### Access Control
- Implements proper authentication gates before rendering sensitive content
- Handles both public and private access scenarios
- Provides secure token-based authentication for API interactions

### Performance Considerations
- Conditional rendering prevents unnecessary component mounting
- Shared mode configuration optimizes for read-heavy scenarios
- Sticky positioning provides smooth UX without performance overhead

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of authentication failures
- Built-in issue reporting for user feedback
- Defensive programming against missing or invalid thread data
