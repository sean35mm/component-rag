# HomeWorkflowsManager Component

## Purpose

The `HomeWorkflowsManager` component is a specialized wrapper around the `WorkflowsManager` component, specifically designed for the home screen. It provides a responsive interface for users to browse and start workflows, with custom styling and layout options optimized for the home page experience.

## Component Type

**Client Component** - Uses the `'use client'` directive (inherited through dependencies) because it utilizes the `useBreakpoint` hook for responsive behavior and manages interactive workflow selection state.

## Props Interface

This component accepts no props - it's a specialized implementation with fixed configuration.

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| - | - | - | No props accepted |

## Usage Example

```tsx
// Basic usage in home page
import { HomeWorkflowsManager } from '@/components/home/components/home-workflows-manager';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div className="home-container">
      <h1>Welcome to the Platform</h1>
      <HomeWorkflowsManager />
    </div>
  );
}

// In a home dashboard layout
function HomeDashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
      <div className="workflow-section">
        <HomeWorkflowsManager />
      </div>
      <div className="other-content">
        {/* Other dashboard content */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Functionality

### Core Features
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically switches between single and two-column layouts based on screen size
- **Custom Styling**: Applies home-specific styling with constrained dimensions and scroll behavior
- **Workflow Management**: Provides interface for browsing and starting workflows
- **Mobile Optimization**: Optimized dimensions and overflow handling for mobile devices

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop (lg+)**: Two-column layout with full height
- **Mobile/Tablet**: Single-column layout with constrained height (308px) and scroll

### UI Configuration
- Custom title: "Start with a workflow"
- Hidden command interface for simplified UX
- Overflow scroll for mobile viewports
- Maximum width constraint relative to viewport

## State Management

The component relies on inherited state management from the `WorkflowsManager` component:
- **Workflow Data**: Managed through TanStack Query for server state
- **Selection State**: Local component state for workflow selection
- **Responsive State**: Uses `useBreakpoint` hook for layout decisions

## Side Effects

- **Responsive Updates**: Automatically updates layout when screen size changes
- **Workflow Loading**: Triggers workflow data fetching through the underlying `WorkflowsManager`
- **Navigation**: May trigger navigation events when workflows are selected

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/components/hooks/use-breakpoint` - Responsive breakpoint detection
- `@/components/omnibar/workflows-manager` - Core workflow management functionality

### External Dependencies
- React hooks for component lifecycle and state management

## Integration

### Application Architecture
```
HomePage
├── HomeWorkflowsManager (this component)
│   └── WorkflowsManager
│       ├── Workflow list rendering
│       ├── Selection handling
│       └── Navigation logic
└── Other home components
```

### Data Flow
1. Component mounts and determines responsive layout
2. Passes configuration to `WorkflowsManager`
3. `WorkflowsManager` fetches workflow data
4. User interactions flow through to workflow execution

### Styling Integration
- Follows Tailwind CSS patterns
- Responsive design using breakpoint classes
- Integrates with overall home page layout system

## Best Practices

### Architecture Adherence
✅ **Component Decomposition**: Clean wrapper pattern, delegates core functionality to specialized component  
✅ **Reusability**: Builds on reusable `WorkflowsManager` with home-specific configuration  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Uses established breakpoint system for consistent responsive behavior  
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Focuses solely on home-specific presentation logic  

### Implementation Patterns
✅ **Configuration Over Customization**: Uses props to configure underlying component rather than duplicating logic  
✅ **Mobile-First Responsive**: Properly handles mobile constraints with appropriate fallbacks  
✅ **Consistent Naming**: Follows domain-based naming conventions (`home-*`)  

### Performance Considerations
✅ **Efficient Re-renders**: Responsive state changes are optimized through `useBreakpoint` hook  
✅ **Lazy Loading**: Inherits efficient data loading from `WorkflowsManager`  
✅ **Scroll Optimization**: Proper overflow handling prevents layout issues  

### Usage Guidelines
- Use only on home/dashboard pages where workflows are the primary action
- Don't modify the configuration - create new variants if different behavior is needed  
- Ensure parent container provides appropriate context for responsive behavior
- Consider loading states when integrating into page layouts
