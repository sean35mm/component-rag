# LogsMobileFallback Component

## Purpose

The `LogsMobileFallback` component provides a mobile-optimized loading skeleton interface for the logs feature in the developers section. It displays placeholder content while actual log data is being fetched, improving perceived performance and user experience on mobile devices.

## Component Type

**Server Component** - This is a presentational component that renders static skeleton content without any client-side interactivity, state management, or browser APIs. It follows our default choice of server components for better performance.

## Props Interface

| Prop Name | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | This component accepts no props |

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { LogsMobileFallback } from '@/components/developers/logs/logs-mobile-fallback';

// In a loading state or Suspense fallback
export default function LogsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="mobile-container">
      <Suspense fallback={<LogsMobileFallback />}>
        <LogsContent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

// Or conditionally based on loading state
export function LogsSection() {
  const { isLoading } = useLogsQuery();
  
  if (isLoading) {
    return <LogsMobileFallback />;
  }
  
  return <LogsList />;
}
```

## Functionality

- **Skeleton Layout**: Renders 15 placeholder log entries with consistent mobile-friendly dimensions
- **Mobile Optimization**: Uses responsive design patterns with appropriate spacing and sizing for mobile viewports
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Maintains the same visual structure as the actual logs component
- **Loading Animation**: Leverages the `Skeleton` component's built-in shimmer animation

### Key Features:
- Header section with skeleton elements for title and metadata
- Grid layout of log entry placeholders (120px height each)
- Proper spacing and border styling matching the actual logs design
- Responsive card-based layout optimized for mobile screens

## State Management

**No State Management** - This component is purely presentational and maintains no internal state. It relies entirely on static rendering of skeleton placeholders.

## Side Effects

**No Side Effects** - This component performs no API calls, data fetching, or external interactions. It's a pure presentational component focused solely on UI rendering.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies:
- `@/components/ui/skeleton` - Core skeleton component for loading animations

### Styling Dependencies:
- Tailwind CSS classes for layout, spacing, and responsive design
- Design system color tokens (`pgStroke-250`, `pgBackgroundWhiteInv-800`)

## Integration

This component integrates into the developers logs feature architecture as a fallback component:

```
src/components/developers/logs/
├── logs-mobile-fallback.tsx    # This component
├── logs-desktop-fallback.tsx   # Desktop equivalent
├── logs-list.tsx              # Actual logs display
└── logs-container.tsx         # Main container with loading logic
```

### Usage Patterns:
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Used as fallback for React Suspense
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displayed during data loading states
- **Mobile-First Design**: Specifically designed for mobile viewport constraints
- **Feature Isolation**: Part of the logs domain-specific components

## Best Practices

✅ **Architectural Compliance:**
- **Server Component Default**: Correctly implemented as a server component since no client-side features are needed
- **Component Decomposition**: Flat structure with single responsibility (loading skeleton)
- **Domain Organization**: Properly placed in the developers/logs feature directory
- **UI Component Reuse**: Leverages the shared `Skeleton` component from `/ui/`

✅ **Design Patterns:**
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the actual logs component layout and spacing
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight component with minimal rendering overhead
- **Accessibility Ready**: Skeleton components provide appropriate loading states for screen readers
- **Mobile-First**: Specifically designed for mobile user experience

✅ **Integration Standards:**
- **No Props Needed**: Simple, focused component that doesn't require configuration
- **Predictable Rendering**: Consistent output every time for reliable loading states
- **Framework Agnostic**: Could easily work with different data fetching patterns (TanStack Query, SWR, etc.)
