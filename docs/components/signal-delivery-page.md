# SignalDeliveryPage Component

## Purpose

The `SignalDeliveryPage` component serves as a container page component for managing email delivery settings for signal alerts and notifications. It provides a user interface for users to add and manage email addresses that will receive signal alerts, combining descriptive text with an interactive list management component.

## Component Type

**Server Component** - This component is implemented as a server component since it only renders static UI elements and composition without requiring client-side interactivity, event handlers, or browser APIs. The interactive functionality is delegated to child components.

## Props Interface

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | This component accepts no props |

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In a settings router or layout component
import { SignalDeliveryPage } from '@/components/settings/signal-delivery/signal-delivery-page';

export default function SettingsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="settings-container">
      <h1>Settings</h1>
      <SignalDeliveryPage />
    </div>
  );
}

// Or as a standalone page
export default function SignalDeliveryRoute() {
  return <SignalDeliveryPage />;
}
```

## Functionality

- **Page Layout**: Provides a structured layout with proper spacing and responsive design
- **User Guidance**: Displays descriptive text explaining the purpose of signal delivery settings
- **Component Composition**: Acts as a container that orchestrates the description and interactive list components
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts margins and spacing based on screen size (mobile vs desktop)

## State Management

**No Direct State Management** - This component is stateless and follows the composition pattern. Any state management is handled by:
- Child components (`SignalDeliveryList`) for interactive functionality
- Likely uses TanStack Query in child components for server state management of email addresses
- Form state managed through React Hook Form in nested components

## Side Effects

**No Direct Side Effects** - This container component has no side effects. Side effects are handled by child components:
- API calls for fetching/updating email addresses occur in `SignalDeliveryList`
- Form submissions and validations handled at the feature component level

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/components/ui/typography` - For consistent text styling and typography
- `./signal-delivery-list` - Core feature component for email management functionality

### External Dependencies
- `React` - For component composition and rendering

## Integration

### Application Architecture
- **Settings Domain**: Part of the settings feature domain, specifically handling signal delivery configuration
- **Page-Level Component**: Designed to be used as a full page or major section within settings
- **Composition Pattern**: Follows our Lego-block composition approach by combining UI and feature components

### Navigation Integration
```tsx
// Typical integration in routing
import { SignalDeliveryPage } from '@/components/settings/signal-delivery/signal-delivery-page';

const settingsRoutes = {
  '/settings/signal-delivery': SignalDeliveryPage,
  // other settings routes...
};
```

### Feature Integration
- Integrates with notification and alerting systems
- Connects to user preferences and account management
- Part of the broader signal management workflow

## Best Practices

### ✅ Architecture Adherence
- **Server Component Default**: Correctly implemented as server component
- **Flat Composition**: Uses composition over deep nesting
- **Domain Organization**: Properly organized within settings/signal-delivery domain
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI description separated from interactive functionality

### ✅ Design Patterns
- **Container Component**: Acts as a pure container for layout and composition
- **Responsive Design**: Implements mobile-first responsive patterns
- **Typography Consistency**: Uses design system typography component
- **Single Responsibility**: Focused solely on page layout and composition

### ✅ Performance Considerations
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Leverages SSR for fast initial page loads
- **Minimal JavaScript**: No client-side JavaScript for this component
- **Efficient Composition**: Delegates complex logic to specialized child components

### ✅ Maintainability
- **Clear Component Boundaries**: Well-defined responsibilities
- **Reusable UI Components**: Uses shared typography component
- **Domain Cohesion**: Co-located with related signal delivery components
