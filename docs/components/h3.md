# H3Mdx Component Documentation

## Purpose

The `H3Mdx` component is a specialized heading component designed for rendering H3 elements within MDX content, specifically for changelog items. It provides consistent typography styling for third-level headings while maintaining semantic HTML structure and accessibility standards.

## Component Type

**Server Component** - This is a server component as it contains no client-side interactivity, event handlers, or browser-specific APIs. It's a pure presentational component that renders static HTML with consistent styling.

## Props Interface

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `...props` | `Omit<HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>, 'color'>` | No | All standard HTML heading attributes except `color`, which is controlled by the Typography component's variant |

### Excluded Props
- `color` - Omitted to ensure consistent styling through the Typography component's variant system

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In MDX content (changelog-item)
# Main Changelog Title

## Version 2.1.0

### New Features  {/* This renders as H3Mdx */}
- Added new API endpoints
- Improved performance

### Bug Fixes    {/* This renders as H3Mdx */}
- Fixed authentication issues
- Resolved memory leaks

// Direct usage in React components
import { H3Mdx } from '@/components/developers/changelog-item/customMdx/h3';

function ChangelogSection() {
  return (
    <div>
      <H3Mdx id="features">New Features</H3Mdx>
      <H3Mdx className="highlight">Breaking Changes</H3Mdx>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Functionality

### Key Features
- **Semantic HTML**: Renders proper `<h3>` elements for document structure and accessibility
- **Consistent Typography**: Applies standardized `titleH3` variant styling across all changelog content
- **Flexible Attributes**: Accepts all standard HTML heading attributes (except color) for customization
- **MDX Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with MDX rendering pipeline for markdown content

### Behaviors
- Renders as a native `<h3>` element with Typography component styling
- Maintains proper heading hierarchy for screen readers and SEO
- Inherits responsive typography scaling from the Typography system

## State Management

**No State Management** - This is a purely presentational component with no internal state, external state dependencies, or state management requirements.

## Side Effects

**No Side Effects** - The component has no side effects, API calls, or external interactions. It's a pure rendering component.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/components/ui/typography` - Core Typography component for consistent text styling
- `React` - For component definition and HTML attributes typing

### Type Dependencies
- `HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>` - TypeScript interface for heading element attributes
- `FC` (Functional Component) - React functional component type

## Integration

### Application Architecture Role
- **Custom MDX Components**: Part of the custom MDX component suite for changelog rendering
- **Developer Documentation**: Specifically designed for the developers section changelog system
- **Typography System**: Integrates with the application's unified typography system
- **Content Rendering**: Enables consistent formatting of structured changelog content

### Integration Points
```tsx
// Typical integration in MDX provider
const mdxComponents = {
  h1: H1Mdx,
  h2: H2Mdx,
  h3: H3Mdx, // ← This component
  // ... other components
};

// Usage in changelog MDX files
<MDXProvider components={mdxComponents}>
  <ChangelogContent />
</MDXProvider>
```

## Best Practices

### Architecture Adherence
✅ **Component Decomposition**: Simple, single-purpose component that stacks well with other MDX components

✅ **Server Component Pattern**: Correctly implemented as server component with no unnecessary client-side code

✅ **Reusability**: Properly scoped to its domain (changelog MDX) while maintaining reusability within that context

✅ **Type Safety**: Properly typed with appropriate prop restrictions (`color` exclusion)

### Usage Recommendations
- **Semantic Structure**: Always use within proper heading hierarchy (after H1/H2 elements)
- **Accessibility**: Leverage standard HTML attributes like `id` for anchor linking
- **Consistency**: Rely on the Typography variant system rather than custom styling
- **MDX Context**: Primarily intended for MDX content rather than direct React component usage

### Performance Considerations
- Zero runtime overhead - compiles to simple HTML elements
- No re-rendering triggers or optimization concerns
- Leverages server-side rendering for optimal performance
